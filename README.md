#1. CreatePredictor_AAINDEX_based 
Protein encoding for mashine learning tasks &amp; predictor's testing methods
Archive CreatePredictor_AAINDEX_based.zip contain c++ program text, for creating predictors by protein sequence.
Predictors based on aminoacid's phisical & chemical properties from databese AAINDEX*.

File TEST\CowardVariables.task is a simple example of tume file for creating predictor's set. 

Аfter program execution, TEST\CowardVariables.task is created, which contains predictor values ​​for sequence "RAPRARAKALRLLLKLLKLLSRYWVRVKRLLL"
given with the testing procedure CowardVariables_test::first_test()

#1. DiscrAnStepwide  - Stepwise discriminant analysis
A model of discrimination is built step-by-step. Specifically, at each step all variables are reviewed and evaluated to determine which one will contribute most to the discrimination between groups.
